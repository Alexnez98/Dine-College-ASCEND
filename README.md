## About ASCEND
ASCEND: Aerospace STEM Challenges to Educate New Discoverers

The Arizona Space Grant Consortium statewide Workforce Development program designed to involve undergraduate students from across Arizona in the full "design-build-fly-operate-analyze" cycle of a space mission. Across our state, student teams from the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, Glendale Community College, Pima Community College (NW and West campuses), Central Arizona College (Signal Peak and Superstition Mountain campuses), Estrella Mountain Community College, Phoenix Community College, and **Diné (Tribal) College**, design and build small payloads for launch from high altitude weather balloons. Teams measure various atmospheric parameters as a function of altitude up to about 100,000 feet and some obtain a series of timed images of the Earth throughout the balloon's ascent to characterize surface features, cloud structure, and the Earth's curvature. Participation in this program is geared to complement regular classroom learning by offering direct hands-on immersion with the full mission cycle--something few NASA or aerospace industry scientists and engineers ever see through.

## ASCEND at Diné College
Diné College of the Navajo Nation offers two- and four-year degrees in various fields including several STEM fields. Our STEM students are given the opportunity to participate in the AZ ASCEND project, and have been participating in ASCEND for at least three years. In 2019, we look forward to having our most productive and successful year yet.
